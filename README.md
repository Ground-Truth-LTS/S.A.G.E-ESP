# S.A.G.E

## Getting started

Install IDF toolchain
Windows
```
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html
```
Linux & Macos
```
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html
```


To test the website locally in the computer install python 3 then run the following command inside the web folder:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

To run in the ESP32 use the following command 

(These operations should be done through the ESP-IDF terminal)

```
idf.py set-target esp32

idf.py build

idf.py flash

idf.py monitor
```

To configure IDF 
```
idf.py menuconfig
```

##Debugging
If during set up: "idf.py build fails", you might be met with the following error:
```
FAILED: partition_table/partition-table.bin C:/Users/UserHere/esp/S.A.G.E/build/partition_table/partition-table.bin
Partitions tables occupies 2.1MB of flash (2162688 bytes) which does not fit in configured flash size 2MB. Change the flash size in menuconfig under the 'Serial Flasher Config' menu.
[5/998] Generating C:/Users/UserHere/esp/S.A.G.E/build/esp-idf/esp_system/ld/sections.ld.in linker script...
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
ninja failed with exit code 1, output of the command is in the C:\Users\UserHere\esp\S.A.G.E\build\log\idf_py_stderr_output_31648 and C:\Users\UserHere\esp\S.A.G.E\build\log\idf_py_stdout_output_31648
```

In which case ensure, that you are using the appropiate flash size for your ESP32.

In case of the ESP32 WROOM32, it has a flash size of 4MB. Which can be changed through the MenuConfig
